# Gis
The Gis project is web a project that displays spatial information on a map using shape files.

I used a map open source code called OpenLayers. Not only does it simply draw a picture on the map, but when you click on the 

map, the information of the terrain feature is displayed on the grid.

### Shape File

To understand the project, you need to know the structure of the shape file.

Please refer to the link below
